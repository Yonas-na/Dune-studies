The #30DayMapChallenge is an annual online event where participants create and share maps daily throughout November, each day based on a specific theme or prompt. It's a fun way for GIS enthusiasts, cartographers, and data visualization lovers to showcase creativity and skills while experimenting with mapping tools and datasets.


Here, you'll find all the maps I've created, each based on the daily prompts for this year's challenge. Feel free to explore, share, and get inspired
